    "## Idea & Motivation\n",
    "One fundamental problem of computer vision is to recognize certain features or images in scenes. In this project our team focused on problem of recognizing and extracting regular patterns on planar surface. These patterns also can be described as \"Low-Ranked matrices\". Camera can deform image low-rank image by some affine or projective, so the problem is to find this tranformation, and recover low-rank structure.  \n"

    "#### Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was mentioned above, we work with the images which after some homography transformation can be represented as a sum of the low rank matrix $A$ and a sparse error matrix $E$\n",
    " . So we can fromulate the optimization objective in the following way $$\\min rk(A)+\\|E\\|_{0}$$\n",
    " Than we add the constraint $$\\tau I=A+E$$\n",
    " where $\\tau$ is the homograpy we are searching for and $I$ is the matrix of the original image. As it was show recently [1], this problem usually can be reformulated in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "\\min\\|A\\|_{\\sigma}+\\|E\\|_{1}\\\\\n",
    "\\tau I=A+E\n",

    "#### Homography\n",

    "To strart with let us precisely define the transformations we are working with. Homography is a coordinate transformation which transform lines to lines. In homogenius coordinates it can be represented as $3\\times3$\n",
    "  matrix. We can think of our image as of the continious function of two variables $I(x,y)$\n",
    " , where $I$\n",
    "  defines intensity in target point. Let $H$\n",
    "  be the matrix of homography, than we transform the coordinates in the following way \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "x\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all we use kind of branch and bound approach to define best initial transformation. We initialize few different rotation matrixes, apply corresponding transformations to the images, calculate the objective, and choose the one which has lowest objective. We do the same for a set of shift matrix, and set initial matrix as a multiplication of choosen shifts and rotates. \n",

The main difficulty was that openCV image transformation routines are able to loose information about image if after transformation it goes otside the frame. To solve this, we wrote a few routines, which shift coordinates by multiplying transformation matrix to special shift matrix, and resize image frame so the significant information is not lost. \n",
