    "## Idea & Motivation\n",
    "One fundamental problem of computer vision is to recognize certain features or images in scenes. In this project our team focused on problem of recognizing and extracting regular patterns on planar surface. These patterns also can be described as Low-Ranked matrices. Camera can deform low-rank image with some affine or projective transformation, so the problem is to find this tranformation, and recover low-rank structure.  \n"

    "#### Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was mentioned above, we work with the images which after some homography transformation can be represented as a sum of the low rank matrix $A$ and a sparse error matrix $E$\n",
    " . So we can fromulate the optimization objective in the following way $$\\min rk(A)+\\|E\\|_{0}$$\n",
    " Than we add the constraint $$\\tau I=A+E$$\n",
    " where $\\tau$ is the homography we are searching for and $I$ is the matrix of the original image. As it was show recently [1], this problem usually can be reformulated in the following way:\n",
